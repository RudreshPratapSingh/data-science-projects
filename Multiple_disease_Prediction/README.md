## 📂 Project Overview

- Predicts **Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease**.  
- Interactive **Streamlit app** for user input and instant results.  
- Pre-trained ML models with **accuracy ~78–80%**.  
- Modular and scalable for adding more diseases in the future.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Streamlit  
- **Model Storage:** Pickle (`.sav` files)  
- **Web Interface:** Streamlit

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Users enter relevant medical parameters:
  - Diabetes → glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, age, etc.  
  - Heart Disease → age, cholesterol, chest pain type, etc.  
  - Parkinson’s → voice signal features like MDVP:Fo(Hz), jitter, shimmer, etc.  
- Pre-trained models are loaded from `.sav` files.  
- Streamlit app displays predictions immediately.
